# Collaborative Recommender System

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the implementation of a collaborative filtering algorithm, which is commonly used for building recommender systems. The notebook provides a comprehensive guide from theoretical concepts to practical implementation, using a dataset that simulates movie ratings by users. It demonstrates how user preferences can be predicted and how movies can be recommended based on these predictions.

## Contents

- `Collab_Filtering_Recommender.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter notebook with step-by-step instructions and code cells for implementing the recommender system.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the analysis.
- `images/`: Directory containing any images or figures generated by the notebook.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

## Usage

Navigate to the `Collab_Filtering_Recommender.ipynb` notebook within the Jupyter interface in your web browser and run the cells sequentially to understand how the collaborative filtering recommender system is implemented and used.
